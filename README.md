# Cowsay

[Cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) is a utility that has been around for a very long time, but is essentially just a toy.

## Installation

You can install it simply by running:

- OSX: `brew install cowsay`
- Ubuntu / Debian: `sudo apt install cowsay`

Sample usage: `cowsay "Hello, world!"`

## Output example

<pre>
 ______________ 
< Hello, world! >
 -------------- 
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
</pre>

It can also generate pictures using pre-made images of other animals, such as Tux the Penguin, the Linux mascot.
